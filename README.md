## Overview

**Expense Tracker** is a **Progressive Web App** built with **Next.js 15** as the final project for a **Mobile Systems** course. The project focuses on key concepts in developing mobile-friendly and offline-capable applications. As a personal challenge, the author also explored the **Next.js App** with **App Router** and related modern web tools.

## Tech Stack

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS v4** 
- **HeroUI**(User beta version at the time of the project) for elegant UI components
- **Heroicons** for elegant icons

### Persistence
- **MongoDB Atlas** for online data storage (Users, Transactions, Push Subscriptions)
- **IndexedDB** for offline storage support

### PWA & Offline Functionality
- Powered by **Serwist**, offering:
    - Service worker integration
    - Fetch request interception
    - Offline caching
    - Push notification handling

### Framework
- Built with **Next.js 15** using **App Router**
- Limited use of **Server Actions** for initial data loading (not optimal for offline mode)

---

## Authentication

Authentication was not a core focus of this project.  
After login user receives ID from database, which is then sent with each request.  
Push subscription endpoints are manually secured via a secret stored in `.env`.

> ðŸ”’ **Future Improvements:**
> - Integrate proper auth (e.g., `next-auth`)
> - Graceful offline handling of authentication flows
